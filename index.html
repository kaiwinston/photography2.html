 <p>I chose this image and edited it the way I did to almost pay homage to the “deep fried meme” trend in 2012 that I used to see when scrolling through vine-- very grainy, usually black and white or completely oversturated. I honestly don’t really know what I did with this image editing wise-- I kind of just raised things to the extreme (and vise versa) to see what would come out. The building is also the cathedral by campus where I eat lunch at everyday-- it’s a really sick environment. It also reminded me of my buddy Jacksons tattoo work-- reach out to me if you’re interested, he works out of Crown Heights.
